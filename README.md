# Improved Github theme for Caret Markdown editor

The very nice Markdown editor [Caret](https://caret.io/) ships with a Github theme on default, but this style is outdated based on Github today.

Like the default, this theme is based on [sindresorhus/github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css).
I made some improvements on content max-width and added the border around the output.

Hope you will like it!

Here's a preview of the output:
